 - DTA-124   (QUAD ASI/SDI Input Adapter for PCI Bus)
 - DTA-140   (DVB-ASI Input/Output Adapter for PCI Bus) 
 - DTA-145   (Multi-Purpose ASI/SDI Adapter for PCI Bus)
 - DTA-160   (Gigabit Ethernet + 3x ASI for PCI Bus)
 - DTA-545   (DVB-ASI  Input/Output Adapter for PC104+)
 - DTA-2111  (Multi-Standard Modulator for PCI Express)
 - DTA-2144  (Quad ASI/SDI Input/Output Adapter for PCI Express)
 - DTA-2145  (Multi-Purpose ASI/SDI Adapter for PCI Express)

- 3. Installation Instructions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To install the driver, perform the following steps:
 - Compile the driver (type "make" in the directory containing the makefile);
 - Install the driver (type "make install" in the directory containing the
   makefile).

NOTE: MAKE SURE THE 'KERNEL_DIR' DEFINE IN THE MAKEFILE SPECIFIES THE CORRECT
      PATH TO THE KERNEL SOURCES.  IF THE SPECIFIED PATH DOES NOT INCLUDE THE
      KERNEL SOURCES, BUT ONLY THE 'USER' SOURCES THE COMPILER MIGHT GENERATE
      THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE: "#warning Using kernel headers in userspace"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- 4. Usage Instructions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To be able to use a DTA-1XX PCI(e) card, the driver must be started and at least
one device file must have been created.

The Dta1xx.init script is provided to start or stop the driver and to create
the device files:

  "sh ./Dta1xxInit start"    Load the driver and create 8 device files
                             in the "/dev" directory.

  "sh ./Dta1xxInit stop"     Unload the driver and remove the device files.

The script uses the following naming convention for device files. The file
name consists of "Dta1xx", followed by the relative board number (0-based).
For example: if the system contains two DTA-1XX cards, then "Dta1xx0"
represents the first board and "Dta1xx1 the second one.

All of the driver's functionality is exposed via the ioctl mechanism (see
"Dta1xxCommon.h" for all ioctl commands). 

For easy usage of the driver, DekTec provides the DTAPI wrapper library.
The DTAPI hides the complexities of using the driver in a few easy-to-use
classes. The DTAPI is included in the Linux SDK.
