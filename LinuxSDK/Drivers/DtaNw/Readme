Refer to the "SDK - Revision History.pdf" document for an overview of the 
changes included in the release.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- 2. Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The DtaNw driver is a network driver for DekTec's DTA-series of PCI/PCIe cards.
Currently the driver provides support for the following cards:
- DTA-160   (GigE + 3x ASI ports for PCI)
- DTA-2160  (GigE + 3x ASI ports for PCI Express)
- DTA-2162  (Dual GigE ports for PCI Express)

The DtaNw driver has the following system requirements:
 - Kernel version 2.6.18 or higher
 - Linux hotplug should be installed


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- 3. Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To install the driver, perform the following steps:
 - Compile the driver (type "make" in the directory containing the makefile);

 NOTE: MAKE SURE THE 'KERNEL_DIR' DEFINE IN THE MAKEFILE SPECIFIES THE CORRECT
      PATH TO THE KERNEL SOURCES.  IF THE SPECIFIED PATH DOES NOT INCLUDE THE
      KERNEL SOURCES, BUT ONLY THE 'USER' SOURCES THE COMPILER MIGHT GENERATE
      THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE: "#warning Using kernel headers in userspace"

 - Install the driver (type "make install" in the directory containing the
   makefile)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- 4. Setup network interface
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Before you can use the network interface, you have to enable it (bring the 
 interface up). You can do it manually or automatic during system start.

 - To bring up the interface manually, and set a static or dynamic IP address
   you have to execute some commands at the console. See the examples below.
   These settings are not persistent and each time the system is restarted
   you have to apply this again.
   
   Example of bringing up the interface with static IP address 192.168.1.1:
       ifconfig eth1 192.168.1.1 up
   Example of bringing up the interface and use DHCP to get an IP address:
        ifconfig eth1 up
        dhclient eth1
    Replace "eth1" by the name of the interface in your system.

 - You can configure a network device so the interface is setup during system
   start. How to configure this is distribution dependent. Below is a short
   description for some distributions. Refer to your distribution 
   documentation for details.
   
   For Debian/Ubuntu and deratives you should add the new network interface to
   the file /etc/network/interfaces. You could for example add the following
   two lines to bring the network interface up automatically at boot time and
   get an IP address via DHCP:
       auto eth1
       iface eth1 inet dhcp
   Replace "eth1" by the name of the interface in your system.
   
   For RHEL/CentOs you create a new file in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts
   with for example this content:
       DEVICE=eth1
       BOOTPROTO=dhcp
       HWADDR=<MAC address, run "/sbin/ifconfig -a" to find this>
       ONBOOT=yes
   Again, replace "eth1" by the name of the network interface and fill in
   HWADDR as appropriate.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- 5. Advanced setup
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The DtaNw driver supports some advanced features that can be enabled/disabled.

These features can be set using a tool such as ethtool. The changes you make
with this tool are not persistent. Some distributions supports the
ETHTOOL_OPTS line in the network configuration files to apply these options
during system boot. See the distribution documentation for details.

The advanced features are:

 - Network Speed/Duplex: You can force the network speed and duplex to a
   specified speed and duplex or set it back to auto-negotiation (default).
   Example:
     Force the speed to 100Mb full-duplex:
        ethtool -s eth1 speed 100 duplex full autoneg off
     Enable auto-negotiation:
        ethtool -s eth1 autoneg on
     Replace "eth1" by the name of the interface in your system.

- Task Offloading: If enabled for transmit, the IP, UDP and TCP checksum
  generation is performed by hardware. If enabled for receive the IP, UDP
  and TCP checksum checking is performed by hardware. This feature is
  enabled by default if supported. Only supported by the DTA-2162.
  Example:
    Disable hardware checksum checking:
        ethtool -K eth1 rx off
    Disable hardware checksum generation:
        ethtool -K eth1 tx off
    Display current offload status:
        ethtool -k eth1
    Replace "eth1" by the name of the interface in your system.

- Frame Check Sequence(FCS). If enabled, the ethernet checksum is added at the
  end of each ethernet packet. Tools such as Wireshark can make use of it to
  indicate the correctness of the complete ethernet packet. This option
  is disabled by default.
  Remark: It's possible that the ethtool does not support enabling the FCS.
  You can also enable this feature by setting the module parameter 
  'g_DtaNwEnableFCS' to 1 during driver load.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- 6. Usage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The DtaNw driver is a network driver that can be used for network communication
like a regular network card.

To use the proprietary interfaces of the card, DekTec provides the
DTAPI wrapper library. The DTAPI hides the complexities of the network
protocols in a few easy-to-use classes. The DTAPI is included in the Linux SDK.
